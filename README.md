# Mystic_Mancers_Game_Engine_Scripts
A collection of unity scripts that I created while programming the game Mystic Mancers and the Crystal of Considerable Power, a 2.5D platformer (still WIP)
I'll be updating this as I make additions and changes to the engine.

The plan was to make the setup mostly component-based, where the users in my dev group could just drag and drop components/scripts into game-objects in unity, and thereby modularily create player characters and enemies using custom "abilities", "ai", "controllers", resources (mana/energy/etc), health, etc...
